# Domain-Driven Design (DDD) in Laravel

This project implements **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** principles in a Laravel application. DDD is a software design approach that focuses on organizing code around the **core business domains**, ensuring that the code structure reflects the real-world business logic and requirements. 

---

## **What is DDD?**

DDD is a development methodology that emphasizes:

- **Domain Logic First**: Prioritizing the core business domain over technical concerns.
- **Decoupling of Code**: Separating technical layers (e.g., database, APIs) from business logic.
- **Clear Boundaries**: Defining distinct domain boundaries to ensure modularity and scalability.

## **Folder Structure**

The project is organized into key layers that align with DDD principles:

```plaintext
app/
├── Domains/                # Core business domains
│   ├── User/               # Domain-specific logic for "User"
│   │   ├── Entities/       # Core entities (e.g., User model abstraction)
│   │   ├── Repositories/   # Interfaces for data access
│   │   ├── Services/       # Business logic for the domain
│   │   ├── ValueObjects/   # Objects representing domain-specific values
│   │   └── Exceptions/     # Custom exceptions for the domain
├── Application/            # Coordinates operations between domains
│   ├── Commands/           # Write operations (create/update/delete)
│   ├── Queries/            # Read operations (fetch data)
│   └── DTOs/               # Data Transfer Objects for communication
├── Infrastructure/         # Technical concerns like database access
│   ├── Persistence/        # Eloquent models and database repositories
│   ├── Messaging/          # Events and messaging systems
│   └── ThirdParty/         # Integrations with external APIs or services
├── Http/                   # Controllers and HTTP requests
│   ├── Controllers/        # Routes to handle HTTP traffic
│   └── Requests/           # Request validation
└── Providers/              # Service providers for dependency injection

### **Explanation of the README:**

- **Introduction to DDD**: The file explains what Domain-Driven Design (DDD) is and its significance in building scalable and business-aligned applications.
- **Project Structure**: The README outlines the folder structure of the project, breaking down each layer and its purpose (e.g., `Domains`, `Application`, `Infrastructure`).
- **Components**: The main components of DDD (entities, repositories, services, value objects, etc.) are explained.
- **API Endpoints**: Examples of API endpoints to interact with the system (such as getting and creating users).
- **Future Improvements**: Possible future improvements such as integrating CQRS or event sourcing.
